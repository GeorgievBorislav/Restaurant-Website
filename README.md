# Restaurant-Website
It is a website about a fictional restaurant. It's done with HTML5, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. The font is custom and inserted so that it will be the same in every browser. Some interesting features are the form for reservations, the slider and the animation that occurs when the width of the windows gets less than a certain amount of pixels.
